ValueError: The `x` passed to condition the posterior for evaluation or sampling
                has an inferred batch shape larger than one. This is not supported in
                some sbi methods for reasons depending on the scenario:

                    - in case you want to evaluate or sample conditioned on several xs
                    e.g., (p(theta | [x1, x2, x3])), this is not supported yet except
                    when using likelihood based SNLE.

                    - in case you trained with a single round to do amortized inference
                    and now you want to evaluate or sample a given theta conditioned on
                    several xs, one after the other, e.g, p(theta | x1), p(theta | x2),
                    p(theta| x3): this broadcasting across xs is not supported in sbi.
                    Instead, what you can do it to call posterior.log_prob(theta, xi)
                    multiple times with different xi.

                    - finally, if your observation is multidimensional, e.g., an image,
                    make sure to pass it with a leading batch dimension, e.g., with
                    shape (1, xdim1, xdim2). Beware that the current implementation
                    of sbi might not provide stable support for this and result in
                    shape mismatches.
