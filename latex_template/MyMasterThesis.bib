	abstract = {Recent advances in probabilistic modelling have led to a large number of simulation-based inference algorithms which do not require numerical evaluation of likelihoods. However, a public benchmark with appropriate performance metrics for such ’likelihood-free’ algorithms has been lacking. This has made it difficult to compare algorithms and identify their strengths and weaknesses. We set out to fill this gap: We provide a benchmark with inference tasks and suitable performance metrics, with an initial selection of algorithms including recent approaches employing neural networks and classical Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We found that the choice of performance metric is critical, that even state-of-the-art algorithms have substantial room for improvement, and that sequential estimation improves sample efficiency. Neural network-based approaches generally exhibit better performance, but there is no uniformly best algorithm. We provide practical advice and highlight the potential of the benchmark to diagnose problems and improve algorithms. The results can be explored interactively on a companion website. All code is open source, making it possible to contribute further benchmark tasks and inference algorithms.},

	abstract = {How can one perform Bayesian inference on stochastic simulators with intractable likelihoods? A recent approach is to learn the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. However, existing methods are limited to a narrow range of proposal distributions or require importance weighting that can limit performance in practice. Here we present automatic posterior transformation ({APT}), a new sequential neural posterior estimation method for simulation-based inference. {APT} can modify the posterior estimate using arbitrary, dynamically updated proposals, and is compatible with powerful flow-based density estimators. It is more flexible, scalable and efficient than previous simulation-based inference techniques. {APT} can operate directly on high-dimensional time series and image data, opening up new applications for likelihood-free inference.},

	abstract = {There has been an increasing interest from the scientific community in using likelihood-free inference ({LFI}) to determine which parameters of a given simulator model could best describe a set of experimental data. Despite exciting recent results and a wide range of possible applications, an important bottleneck of {LFI} when applied to time series data is the necessity of defining a set of summary features, often hand-tailored based on domain knowledge. In this work, we present a data-driven strategy for automatically learning summary features from univariate time series and apply it to signals generated from autoregressive-moving-average ({ARMA}) models and the Van der Pol Oscillator. Our results indicate that learning summary features from data can compete and even outperform {LFI} methods based on hand-crafted values such as autocorrelation coefficients even in the linear case.},

To address this problem, we built Human Neocortical Neurosolver ({HNN}, https://hnn.brown.edu) software. {HNN} has a graphical user interface designed to help researchers and clinicians interpret the neural origins of {MEG}/{EEG}. {HNN}’s core is a neocortical circuit model that accounts for biophysical origins of electrical currents generating {MEG}/{EEG}. Data can be directly compared to simulated signals and parameters easily manipulated to develop/test hypotheses on a signal’s origin. Tutorials teach users to simulate commonly measured signals, including event related potentials and brain rhythms. {HNN}’s ability to associate signals across scales makes it a unique tool for translational neuroscience research.},

	abstract = {Auditory evoked fields ({AEFs}) are commonly studied, yet their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we used the biophysical modelling software Human Neocortical Neurosolver ({HNN}) whose foundation is a canonical neocortical circuit model to interpret the cell and network mechanisms contributing to macroscale {AEFs} elicited by a simple tone, measured with magnetoencephalography. We found that {AEFs} can be reproduced by activating the neocortical circuit through a layer specific sequence of feedforward and feedback excitatory synaptic drives, similar to prior simulation of somatosensory evoked responses, supporting the notion that basic structures and activation patterns are preserved across sensory regions. We also applied the modeling framework to develop and test predictions on neural mechanisms underlying {AEF} differences in the left and right hemispheres, as well as in hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to the presentation of the auditory stimulus. We found that increasing the strength of the excitatory synaptic cortical feedback inputs to supragranular layers simulates the commonly observed right hemisphere dominance, while decreasing the input latencies and simultaneously increasing the number of cells contributing to the signal accounted for the contralateral dominance. These results provide a direct link between human data and prior animal studies and lay the foundation for future translational research examining the mechanisms underlying alteration in this fundamental biomarker of auditory processing in healthy cognition and neuropathology.},

In this technical note, we propose a probabilistic framework, namely the Bayesian Virtual Epileptic Patient ({BVEP}), which relies on the fusion of structural data of individuals to infer the spatial map of epileptogenicity in a personalized large-scale brain model of epilepsy spread. To invert the individualized whole-brain model employed in this study, we use the recently developed algorithms known as No-U-Turn Sampler ({NUTS}) as well as Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference ({ADVI}). Our results indicate that {NUTS} and {ADVI} accurately estimate the degree of epileptogenicity of brain regions, therefore, the hypothetical brain areas responsible for the seizure initiation and propagation, while the convergence diagnostics and posterior behavior analysis validate the reliability of the estimations. Moreover, we illustrate the efficiency of the transformed non-centered parameters in comparison to centered form of parameterization. The Bayesian framework used in this work proposes an appropriate patient-specific strategy for estimating the epileptogenicity of the brain regions to improve outcome after epilepsy surgery.},

	title = {Fast -free Inference of Simulation Models with Bayesian Conditional Density Estimation},
	abstract = {Many statistical models can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian Computation ({ABC}) methods are used to infer properties of these models from data. Traditionally these methods approximate the posterior over parameters by conditioning on data being inside an -ball around the observed data, which is only correct in the limit → 0. Monte Carlo methods can then draw samples from the approximate posterior to approximate predictions or error bars on parameters. These algorithms critically slow down as → 0, and in practice draw samples from a broader distribution than the posterior. We propose a new approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesian conditional density estimation. Preliminary inferences based on limited simulation data are used to guide later simulations. In some cases, learning an accurate parametric representation of the entire true posterior distribution requires fewer model simulations than Monte Carlo {ABC} methods need to produce a single sample from an approximate posterior.},

	abstract = {Motor cortical activity in the beta frequency range is one of the strongest and most studied movement-related neural signals. At the single trial level, beta band activity is often characterized by transient, high amplitude, bursting events rather than slowly modulating oscillations. The timing of these bursting events is tightly linked to behavior, suggesting a more dynamic functional role for beta activity than previously believed. However, the neural mechanisms underlying beta bursts in sensorimotor circuits are poorly understood. To address this, we here leverage and extend recent developments in high precision {MEG} for temporally resolved laminar analysis of burst activity, combined with a neocortical circuit model that simulates the biophysical generators of the electrical currents which drive beta bursts. This approach pinpoints the generation of beta bursts in human motor cortex to distinct excitatory synaptic inputs to deep and superficial cortical layers, which drive current flow in opposite directions. These laminar dynamics of beta bursts in motor cortex align with prior invasive animal recordings within the somatosensory cortex, and suggest a conserved mechanism for somatosensory and motor cortical beta bursts. More generally, we demonstrate the ability for uncovering the laminar dynamics of event-related neural signals in human non-invasive recordings. This provides important constraints to theories about the functional role of burst activity for movement control in health and disease, and crucial links between macro-scale phenomena measured in humans and micro-circuit activity recorded from animal models.},
